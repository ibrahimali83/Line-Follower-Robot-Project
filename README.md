# Line-Follower-Robot-Project

- I implemented this project individually during robotics course, it is a differential wheeled robot that follows a line drawn on the ground by detecting a dark line on a white surface, programmed using Arduino IDE. 
- The project implemented on hardware model and Arduino kit.
